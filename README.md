# cloudfront-s3-static-site

An AWS project where I deploy a static site to AWS S3 and distribute it securely using AWS cloudfrontðŸ¥‡. In this project I uploaded the html, css and required image files to an S3 bucket I created on AWS, and made the bucket publicly available for static site hosting. I used the CloudFront CDN to distibute the site securely.
